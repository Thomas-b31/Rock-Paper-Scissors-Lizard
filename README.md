# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard

In natural populations of the lizard Uta stansburiana, there are three male morphs with different colors and mating strategies:

**Orange males** are aggressive and control large territories with many females.

**Blue males** are less aggressive, defend small territories, and guard a few females.

**Yellow males** have no territory and sneak matings when orange males are away.

Their competition follows a rock-paper-scissors dynamic: Orange beats Blue, Blue beats Yellow, Yellow beats Orange. These traits are heritable, and morph frequencies fluctuate over time but all three persist.

The projectâ€™s goal is to simulate this system to understand these population oscillations. The model only includes males and simulates duels on a 2D grid, tracking morph frequencies over time to see if all morphs can persist in the long term.
